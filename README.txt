The ./data contains the data features used by the robot to calculate the optimal question to ask the human oponent.

The ./project_code/objects.py file is the main python script used for playing the game. When run, the game commences.

In order for the robot to identify the faces it is shown (via fiducial tags), the accompanying .crg file should also be run.
This .crg file is not included in the github folder, but is in the .zip file with the rest of the final submission.
